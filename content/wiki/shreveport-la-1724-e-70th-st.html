<h2>History</h2>
Shreveport opened in the Eastgate Plaza Center (1724 E 70th St) on August 2nd, 1982, with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}, most likely having Madame Oink as the guest star. This location also had the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese Play-N-Place" >}} upon opening. It is unknown what cabaret act they had at this time as there is hardly any information about this location. Shreveport would close on May 3rd, 1987 (reason unknown), with an auction taking place on June 6th, 1987.
<h2>Post PTT</h2>
It's unknown how long / if the building was left vacant. It is also unknown what took the place of the former PTT. As of 2025, typing the address into Google Maps shows a Red River Bank and a Hunter Crab restaurant.
