The <b><i>Billy Bob Cyberstar Walkaround</b></i> was a walkaround used exclusively for <i>Cyberstar</i> videos at the {{< wiki-link "Showbiz Pizza Time Corporate Office" >}}.
The walkaround was produced by J&M Costumers, alongside the other costumes used in the Cyberstar videos.<sup>(1)</sup>

<h2> Variants </h2> There first version of the Billy Bob  Walkaround was not used in the Cyberstar videos, instead they used the  {{< wiki-link "Billy Bob Standard Walkaround" >}} it is unclear why they didn't use the one made. The way you would be able to see out of the costume was possibly through the eyes or mouth.
