<b><i>Satchemo </b></i> was the horn player from The Santa Claus Revue.
<h2> History </h2>
Satchemo was installed in 1977 in Santa's Village (Jefferson, New Hampshire) by Creative Engineering (1) for the first full show that they developed, where he operated until 2015/2016. In 2006, the animatronics were replaced by ones created by Advanced Animations, but the showtape wasn't replaced. (2)
<h2> Design </h2>
He is Elf with large eyes and bushy eyebrow; he wore a festive outfit with a Santa hat and was also holding a horn. 
<h2> Movements <h2>
The animatronic got 5 movements, but during the remodeling, it lost 1 movement: the eye popped out, but, the leg got a tap movement during the remodeling. (3)
