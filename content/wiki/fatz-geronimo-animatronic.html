The Fatz Geronimo Animatronic (Also the 3-Stage Mr. Munch Animatronic) was one of the main {{< wiki-link "Classic Stage" >}} animatronics produced by Creative Engineering Inc. The animatronic would first be developed in April of 1980, before debuting at the {{< wiki-link "Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}} on August 14th of that year. His character was based off Fats Gorilla from the {{< wiki-link "Wolf Pack 5" >}} animatronic show Creative Engineering had developed.
<h2> History </h2>
Fatz Geronimo animatronics would continue to be produced up until 1983. The January batch would be the last used inside Showbiz Pizza restaurants, and would be kept and stored for future openings, while Creative Engineering would continue to produce bots until June. Now with a surplus of bots, these would need to be sold to other family entertainment centers.
During {{< wiki-link "Concept Unification" >}}, Fatz Geronimo would now become Mr. Munch<i>,</i> sporting a hat, purple fur, yellow fur, and a new organ front. The only mechanical change was the lowering of air pressure for his movements, and later diagnostic changes to the air flow in the cylinders. Another process which some stores would also choose not to go forward with. In April of 2001 a major change would come for all 3-Stage bots in stores. Their previously latex masks would now be changed out for furred plastic ones, to reduce costs for the rapidly deteriorating latex. Around this time stores would also be offered the ability to purchase new eyes for their 3-Stage characters, now with smaller pupils and more detailed irises. Store owners were also encouraged to repaint the eyelids with Rust-Oleum Painters Touch spray paint.
<h2> Design </h2>
Fatz is a large gorilla with black fur and a broad and flat nose and light brown eye, he also has a protruding brow ridge and a set of 16 square teeth. His face, feet and hands are bare and not covered in fur and the arms and Feet  has opposable thumbs and toes.
 He is wearing a golden and sparkling tuxedo with a 3 button white shirt underneath 
<h2> Mechanical Structure </h2>
<h3> Movements </h3>
The bot features sixteen movements in total. 
No movements were removed during Concept Unification, unlike {{< wiki-link "Rolfe Dewolfe & Earl Schmerle (Animatronic)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "Dook Larue (Animatronic)" >}}.
